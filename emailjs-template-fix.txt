# Fix for EmailJS Contact Form Template

Since modifying the code hasn't resolved the issue, please update your EmailJS template directly:

1. Log in to EmailJS.com
2. Go to "Email Templates" 
3. Click on your "Contact Us" template (ID: template_7eq2f1a)
4. Replace the current template content with this exact text:

```
Hello Reyhaneh,

You got a new message from {{from_name}}:

Subject: {{subject}}

Message:
{{message}}

Contact Email: {{reply_to}}

Best wishes,
EmailJS team
```

5. Save the template
6. Test your form again

Important: Make sure there are no extra spaces or formatting issues in the template variables. They should be exactly as shown above.

This template uses the exact variable names that are sent from your website's contact form.
